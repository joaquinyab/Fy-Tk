yfinance is a library where you can see stocks, crypto and tickers information. Price, making graphs, low, high, etc. and tkinter is a gui library, so i decided to combine both,
with the yfinance information and the GUI of tkinter i could make a combination, where you can look for every ticker price from 2010 to today's date.
I will be uploading new versions of this app
